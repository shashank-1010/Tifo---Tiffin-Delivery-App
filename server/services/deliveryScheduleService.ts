// ✅ NEW FILE
// Generates and live-computes the day-by-day delivery schedule for a
// weekly/monthly tiffin subscription (bookingType "weekly" | "monthly").
//
// Design:
// - The schedule (which dates + which weekday) is generated ONCE, right when the
//   subscription is booked, and saved on the booking (`deliverySchedule`).
// - The STATUS of each day ("Pending" / "Delivered" / "Missed") is never stored —
//   it's recomputed every time the schedule is read, by comparing each day's date
//   to today. That's what makes "delivered or not" behave like a real, live
//   subscription instead of a static, hardcoded list: a day that shows "Pending"
//   today will automatically show "Delivered" tomorrow, with no extra code.
